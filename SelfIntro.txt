
**Self-Introduction (Corrected):**

Hi, my name is JayaPrakash, and Iâ€™m currently working as a Software Test Engineer. I have 2.7 years of experience in software testing.

I began my career with a focus on manual testing, where I gained a strong understanding of core testing concepts such as test case design, defect identification, and bug reporting.

Later, I transitioned into automation testing, gaining hands-on experience with tools like Selenium WebDriver, and frameworks such as BDD with Cucumber, TDD with TestNG and JUnit, as well as the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
I also have experience in API testingâ€”using Postman for manual testing and Rest Assured for automation.

Iâ€™ve been involved in developing and maintaining automated test scripts to support faster, more reliable, and repeatable test execution across builds.

I have strong experience in defect management using JIRA, including logging, tracking, and ensuring closure of bugs, while closely collaborating with development teams to deliver high-quality releases.

I'm comfortable working with version control systems like Git and have hands-on experience integrating automated tests into CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing and deployment.

In terms of methodology, Iâ€™ve been working in Agile-based projects since the start of my career and have actively participated in all key sprint ceremonies, including planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives.

Additionally, I have basic knowledge of mobile automation using Appium, and Iâ€™m also familiar with databases like MySQL for validating data at the backend.

Iâ€™m always keen to learn new tools and technologies and continuously strive to improve product quality and contribute to overall team efficiency.

**Self-Introduction for Interview**

My name is **Jayaprakash Ravi**, and Iâ€™m currently working as a **Software Test Engineer**. I have **2.7 years of experience** in both **manual and automation testing**.

I specialize in testing web-based applications and have hands-on experience using **Selenium WebDriver with Java** for automating functional and regression test scenarios. I'm well-versed in **BDD frameworks using Cucumber**, and Iâ€™ve developed and maintained robust frameworks using **TestNG, JUnit, Maven**, and **Page Object Model** design patterns to ensure reusability and scalability.

At my current organization, Iâ€™m working on a project called **Sayweee**, an online grocery delivery platform. Here, Iâ€™m responsible for creating and executing both manual and automated test cases, performing **end-to-end testing across UI, API, and backend systems**, and validating key flows such as login, search, payments, and loyalty.

I also have solid experience in **API testing** using **Postman** and **Rest Assured**, validating payloads, status codes, and schema structures. Additionally, I perform **backend validations** using **SQL queries** to ensure data integrity.

As part of the Agile team, I actively participate in all Scrum ceremonies including **daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives**, and collaborate closely with developers and business analysts to ensure requirement clarity and coverage.

Iâ€™m also comfortable with tools like **JIRA for defect tracking**, **Git for version control**, and **Jenkins for CI/CD** pipeline integration, which helps in achieving continuous testing and early bug detection.

In terms of soft skills, I bring strong **analytical thinking**, **problem-solving abilities**, and a collaborative mindset that helps me work efficiently in cross-functional teams.

Iâ€™m currently looking for a challenging role where I can contribute to quality assurance processes and continue growing my skills in automation and testing strategies.
