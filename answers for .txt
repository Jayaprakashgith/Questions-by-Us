1)What Automation Testing?
Ans :
    Automation Testing is a software testing method that uses specialized tools or scripts to automatically execute test cases—without human intervention.
@Common Tools:
   *Selenium (for web apps)
   *JUnit/TestNG (Java-based frameworks)
   *Appium (for mobile apps)
   *Cypress, Playwright, Postman (for frontend/backend/API testing)

==================================================================================
6)Advantages of automation testing
Ans:
    * Faster Test excusion 
    * Expands coverage for different browsers, devices, and data 
    * Reduced Human Error 
    * Cost Cost-effectiveness

==================================================================================
2)Passing multiple values into a single field, function, or test case
Ans:
	1. Use DataProviders (In TestNg)
	2. Parameterized Tests (in JUnit)

=============================================================
42)How to pass Data from Excel to selenium?
Ans :
	1. Add Apache POI to Your Project
	2. Read Data from Excel --> Use XSSFWorkbook for .xlsx files and HSSFWorkbook for .xls
	3. Use @DataProvider in TestNG to feed test data From Excel.

========================================================================
3)Implicity and explicity wait
Ans:
   	*Implicit wait sets a default timeout for all elements, making Selenium wait before throwing NoSuchElementException. 
   	*Explicit wait targets specific elements or conditions, waiting until they're ready (like clickable or visible).

==============================================================
4)What are the locators in selenium?
Ans:
 	*byId
 	*byName

===============================================================
13)what is an xpath?
Ans:
  XPath is a powerful query language used to navigate and locate elements in an XML or HTML document.

=================================================================
5) What are the differences between CSS selectors and XPath?
Ans:
     Both are used to find the locator of the elements where using css Selector we can find locators in forward direction only ,but using xpath we can find in both forward direction and backward direction  

==================================================================================
25) Absolute xpath & Relative xpath ?
Ans:
    * Absolute xpath
      --------------
       Starts from the root node and traverses down to desired element  
Ex:
---     
  /html/body/div/div/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/form/div/div/input

  * Relative xpath
    -------------
        Start from the current node and search for the desired element

==================================================================================
9)Full form of TestNG
Ans:
   	* The full form of TestNG is Test Next Generation.
   	* It's a powerful testing framework inspired by JUnit but designed to cover more test categories—like unit, functional, integration, and end-to-end testing. It's especially popular in Java-based automation, offering features like parallel test execution, grouping, data-driven testing, and detailed reports.
 
==================================================================================	
10)Purposes of JUnit?
Ans:
  	* Write And Run Tests 
  	* Catch Bugs And Errors
  	* Improve Code Quality

==================================================================================
11)how do you choose framework for your project?
Ans:
  	* Project Requirements
  	* Team Expertise
	* Community & Support
	* Scalability & Flexibility

=================================================================
7)Regression Testing:
Ans:
    	It is done to make sure the existing functionalities of the application is not impacted whenever any new functionalities is added to the application.

==================================================================================
8)Sanity Testing:
Ans:
    	Sanity Testing is done during the release phase to check the main functionalities of the application without going deeper. It is also called as a subset of Regression testing. At times due to release time constraints, regression testing can't be done to the build, in that case sanity testing does that part by checking main functionalities.

==================================================================================
