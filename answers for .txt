1)What Automation Testing?
Ans :
    Automation Testing is a software testing method that uses specialized tools or scripts to automatically execute test cases—without human intervention.
@Common Tools:
   *Selenium (for web apps)
   *JUnit/TestNG (Java-based frameworks)
   *Appium (for mobile apps)
   *Postman (for API testing)

==================================================================================
6)Advantages of automation testing
Ans:
    * Faster Test excusion 
    * Expands coverage for different browsers, devices, and data 
    * Reduced Human Error 
    * Cost Cost-effectiveness

==========================================================================
2)Passing multiple values into a single field, function, or test case
Ans:
	1. Use DataProviders (In TestNg)
	2. Parameterized Tests (in JUnit)

=============================================================
42)How to pass Data from Excel to selenium?
Ans :
	1. Add Apache POI to Your Project
	2. Read Data from Excel --> Use XSSFWorkbook for .xlsx files and HSSFWorkbook for .xls
	3. Use @DataProvider in TestNG to feed test data From Excel.

==============================================================
3)Implicity and explicity wait
Ans:
   	*Implicit wait sets a default timeout for all elements, making Selenium wait before throwing NoSuchElementException. 
   	 	--> driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(30));

	*Explicit wait targets specific elements or conditions, waiting until they're ready (like clickable or visible).
		1. WebDriver Wait --> WebElement wRefName = driver.findElement(By.id(--));
					 WebDriverWait waitRef = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(20));
					               waitRef.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(wRefName));
		2. Fluent Wait    --> Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
							     .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))               // Maximum wait time
    							     .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5))               // Check every 5 seconds
    							     .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);

==============================================================
4)What are the locators in selenium?
Ans:
 	*byId

Ans:
  	* XPath is a query language used to navigate and locate elements in an XML or HTML document.
	* It is Used to find the locators in the Webpage 

=================================================================
5) What are the differences between CSS selectors and XPath?
Ans:
     Both are used to find the locator of the elements where using css Selector we can find locators in forward direction only ,but using xpath we can find in both forward direction and backward direction  

==================================================================================
25) Absolute xpath & Relative xpath ?
Ans:
    * Absolute xpath
      --------------
       Starts from the root node and traverses down to desired element  
Ex:
---     
  /html/body/div/div/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/form/div/div/input

  * Relative xpath
    -------------
        Start from the current node and search for the desired element

==================================================================================
8)Sanity Testing:
Ans:
    	Sanity Testing is done during the release phase to check the main functionalities of the application without going deeper. It is also called as a subset of Regression testing. At times due to release time constraints, regression testing can't be done to the build, in that case sanity testing does that part by checking main functionalities.
